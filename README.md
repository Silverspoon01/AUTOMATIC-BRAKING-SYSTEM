# AUTOMATIC-BRAKING-SYSTEM
This paper presents the implementation of an automatic braking system using the Tiva C Series microcontroller and DC motors. The system employs an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and controls the DC motors to prevent collisions. The microcontroller continuously measures the distance to obstacles and compares it against a predefined minimum threshold of 10 cm. If an obstacle is detected within this threshold, the system triggers a safety protocol by blinking an onboard LED, stopping the DC motors, and sending alerts via the serial monitor. The system is programmed using the Energia IDE and validated on the Tiva C Series microcontroller, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-time automatic braking applications. This study discusses the system design, implementation details, and experimental results, highlighting the practical applicability of the developed automatic braking system in enhancing safety for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems.
